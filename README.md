This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

###  This project is to apply JS, TS and React good practices as I am watching the tutorials on Udemy Courses

* Status: under development (as I am learning and building)
* The project is aimed to achieve good practices of using TS/JS and React
* Special thanks to Free Dictionary API, this app cannot be built without a free dictionary API like this!
* What to expect (when I'm done)
    * A small app that allows us to search and add to our browser storage favorite words (not too much words as your browser has a very small limit amount of storage)
    * Applying good practices in both TS/JS and React including proper use of TS types, components splitting (atomic pattern), data fetching/rendering, state management with redux, fetching data with GraphQL (right now I'm using RESTs and SWR for data fetching, just for now!) and more!
    * SEO friendly with dynamic routes 

* Keywords: Next.js, TypeScript, MUI, Redux, React Hook Form, GraphQL...
